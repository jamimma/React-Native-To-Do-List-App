# React Native To-Do List App

## Project Description
**React Native To-Do List App** is a mobile application built using React Native that helps users efficiently manage their daily tasks. Users can **add, view, edit, and delete tasks**. Tasks are saved persistently using **AsyncStorage**, so they remain stored even after closing the app.

The app also supports optional features like marking tasks as completed, filtering tasks by status (All/Pending/Completed), and a simple, clean UI for better user experience. This project demonstrates the use of **React Native components, state management, props, lists, and local storage**.
